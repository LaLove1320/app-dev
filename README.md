### My Favorite Movies of All Times

## *Flipped*.

> The movie *Flipped* follows children Bryce Loski and Juli Baker in a period of coming of age starting when Juli moves into Bryce's neighborhood in the second grade. She develops an annoying and persistent crush on him that Bryce just wants to go away but over six years their feelings flip for each other.

>> Back when I was a high school student up until now, I still used to love the movie because I couldn't forget how it made me feel butterflies in my stomach.
